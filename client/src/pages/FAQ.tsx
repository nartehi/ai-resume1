        },
        {
          q: "How does the ATS scoring work?",
          a: "Our ATS (Applicant Tracking System) scoring analyzes four key areas: Keyword Integration (40 points), Job Requirements Match (30 points), Resume Completeness (20 points), and Formatting Quality (10 points). You receive a total score out of 100 with detailed breakdowns for each category."
        },
        {
          q: "What file formats do you support?",
          a: "We currently support PDF, DOC, DOCX, and TXT file formats for resume uploads. For best results, we recommend using PDF or DOCX formats."

      questions: [
        {
          q: "How does the AI optimization work?",
          a: "Our AI analyzes your resume and the job description to identify missing keywords, skills gaps, and formatting issues. It then suggests specific improvements and can automatically generate an optimized version of your resume that better matches the job requirements while maintaining your authentic voice."
        },
        {
          q: "Can I optimize my resume for multiple jobs?",
          a: "Yes! You can analyze and optimize your resume for as many different job descriptions as you want. We recommend tailoring your resume for each specific position you apply to for the best results."
        },
        {
          q: "What are Job-Relevant Skills & Terms?",
          a: "These are keywords, skills, and phrases extracted from the job description that are missing or underrepresented in your resume. You can select which ones to add, and our AI will integrate them naturally into your optimized resume."
        },
        {
          q: "How is my optimized resume saved?",
          a: "Your optimized resume is saved with a filename format of 'YourName_Date_CompanyName_optimized.txt'. This makes it easy to keep track of different versions for different job applications."

          a: "Absolutely. We take your privacy seriously. All resume data is processed using encrypted connections, and we don't store your personal information or resume content on our servers permanently. Your data is only used for the analysis you request."
        },
        {
          q: "Do you share my resume with employers?",
          a: "No, we never share your resume or personal information with anyone. CareerLab AI is purely a tool for you to optimize your own resume. You have complete control over your data."
        },
        {
          q: "What happens to my data after analysis?",
          a: "Currently, we process your resume in real-time and don't store it in a database. Once you close your session, your data is not retained on our servers."

          q: "I'm getting a timeout error when analyzing my resume. What should I do?",
          a: "Timeout errors can occur if the job description is very long or if there's high server traffic. Try breaking down very long job descriptions into key sections, or try again in a few moments. If the problem persists, please contact our support team."
        },
        {
          q: "Why isn't my resume uploading?",
          a: "Make sure your file is in a supported format (PDF, DOC, DOCX, or TXT) and is under 10MB in size. Also check that the file isn't corrupted or password-protected."

      questions: [
        {
          q: "How can I get the best ATS score?",
          a: "To maximize your ATS score: (1) Include relevant keywords from the job description naturally in your resume, (2) Ensure your resume is complete with all standard sections, (3) Use clean, simple formatting, and (4) Match your experience to the job requirements as closely as possible."
        },
        {
          q: "Should I use all suggested keywords?",
          a: "Not necessarily. Only add keywords that genuinely reflect your skills and experience. Adding irrelevant keywords can backfire during the interview process. Select the skills you actually have and can speak to confidently."
        },
        {
          q: "How often should I update my resume?",
          a: "You should tailor your resume for each job application. Use CareerLab AI to optimize your resume specifically for each position you're applying to, as different jobs emphasize different skills and requirements."
